## State management in React

- [ ] What are the different types of state

  - Local state (living in component)
  - Shared state (Context API)
  - Remote state (Data source)
  - Async state (status of async communication with remote data - loading, error, stalling, success)

- [ ] When to use what type of state

  - Start with the simplest form (often local state)
  - Local state can eventually graduate to shared state

- [ ] Would you reach for any state management library?

  - Is a context provider with useState/useReducer a viable option?
